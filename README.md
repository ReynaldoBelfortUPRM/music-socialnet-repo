#Sprint 0


**What Worked Well?**


1. The use of Trello to generate ideas, organize, and create discussions for specifics topics related to the project.

2. Every member was always in communication via WhatsApp or Trello.

3. The differences of each member and how we used those in our favor.



**What Didn’t Worked Well?**


1. There was a point where the members did not have the same vision about the project.

2. The frameworks were specified in a moment, but later were changed.

3. Not having a specific meeting in the week.

4. Had not specified the tasks of the sprint that each member would have in charge from the beginning of working. 



**What We Learned?**


1. Get to a medium point in the different visions of the idea for the project


2. Select a specific day and hour in which we will have our weekly meeting.


3. We should assign specific tasks of each sprint to the members of the group.


4. The use of software like Trello or the Kanban System is really helpful for team organization.
