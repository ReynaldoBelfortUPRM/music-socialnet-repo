    In the following document the reader can find all of the information pertaining to the function, development, and use of the social-network.
   
> **1.1 Purpose**

>    The purpose of this document is to depict and provide a detailed description of the requirements and specifications of the social network to be developed to the interested parties.

> **1.2 Scope**

>     The MusicVenue is a web-based social network dedicated to creating a community of musicians who can share their creations with the world under an artistic environment while also providing them with space to publish announcements with those who follow them. 

>     Musicians can link their work in audio and video formats to their profile via alternate web pages, giving other users the opportunity to enjoy their creations. The user can share other content, such as events and sales, as well as basic information about their musical background.

>     Another key component to MusicVenue is the ability users have to follow musicians whom they are interested in, where the user will receive notifications about any new uploads and announcements. In order to create an event, the administrator of the entity must abide by basic CRUD operations. Under events, information such as the location in which it will take place, the date, attendance, and the amount of privacy involved will be displayed.
